## Layout

This hardware layout is done using Kicad. You can download it for free [here](https://kicad.org).
The Idea is to put the engine and the battery on seperate wagons. This gives me more space and more
comfortably purchasable parts. So in the tradition of old steam engines, the motor is in front,
the charcoal heap (battery) on the rear wagon.

## BOM

The parts list (or bill of material - BOM) can be accessed here. If this shop isn't the right one for you,
use the one you prefer.

Otherwise, here's a list of the most important parts with a brief explaination.

| ID | Amount | Type|  Description |
| --- | --> | ---- | --- |
| IC1 | 1 | XIAO ESP32C6 board | microcontroller with bluetooth interface |
| IC2 | 1 | ST SPIN233 | low voltage motor voltage controller  |
